    # The vulnerability (segfault or out-of-sandbox load with f64.copysign on x86-64) only triggers
    # when signals-based-traps is DISABLED in the wasmtime Config.
    # Substrate's sc-executor-wasmtime uses wasmtime::Config::new() which has signals_based_traps
    # enabled by default, and never disables it. Therefore this code path is never exercised.
