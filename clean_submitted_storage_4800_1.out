2026-01-09 11:50:31 Using the chain spec instead of the runtime to generate the genesis state is deprecated. Please remove the `--chain`/`--dev`/`--local` argument, point `--runtime` to your runtime blob and set `--genesis-builder=runtime`. This warning may become a hard error any time after December 2024.
